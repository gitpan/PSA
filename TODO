Before the 0.50 release:

  - tidy up the examples in the examples/ directory, provide some more
    examples including trivial ones with no controllers, just
    templates.

  - make sure the default scriptlets and templates in share/ are
    delivered during `make install' phase, and that they are actually
    generic enough to be useful for building sites...

  - finish off the psa wrapper script, and PSA::Init.

  - make all the tests pass and make new tests for untested
    functionality (*sigh* - SNAFU - at least the documentation is
    fairly comprehensive though)

For a 0.60 release:

  - a system of templates and controller scripts to deliver a
    Maypole-like system for direct editing of model objects.

  - add support to psa for pre-building partial static content in a
    site from a set of templates.
